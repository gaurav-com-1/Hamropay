One of the most dangerous and lesser-known threats is the SIM swap scam. It allows a criminal to take control of your phone number, which is often the key to all your digital accounts, including wallets and banks.

### What is a SIM Swap Scam?

A SIM swap is when a scammer convinces your mobile provider (like NTC or Ncell) to transfer your phone number to a new SIM card that they possess. Once they have control of your number, they receive all your calls, messages, and most importantly, your One-Time Passwords (OTPs).

### How Does it Happen?

The scammer first gathers your personal information, often from social media or data leaks. They then contact your mobile provider, impersonating you. They might claim your phone was lost or the SIM was damaged. Using your personal details to answer security questions, they trick the provider into deactivating your SIM and activating the new one in their possession.

### The Biggest Red Flag

> If your phone suddenly loses network signal and you can't make calls or send texts for an extended period (while others around you can), this is a major warning sign. It doesn't just mean a network error; it could mean your SIM has been deactivated.

### How to Protect Yourself

1.  **Guard Your Personal Information:** Don't overshare details like your full date of birth or citizenship number online.
2.  **Set a PIN on Your SIM Card:** Most phones allow you to set a PIN that must be entered when the phone is restarted or the SIM is placed in a new device. This adds an extra layer of protection.
3.  **Act Immediately:** If you suspect a SIM swap, contact your mobile provider and your bank/wallet companies immediately to block your accounts.
