One of the most common and effective scams targeting Nepalis today is OTP (One-Time Password) fraud. It relies on social engineering—manipulating people into giving up confidential information—rather than hacking complex systems.

### The Anatomy of the Scam

You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be a representative from eSewa, Khalti, or even your bank. They sound professional and convincing. They might say:

- "We are updating our system and need to verify your account."
- "You have won a cash prize and we need to confirm your identity to transfer the funds."
- "There has been a suspicious transaction on your account, and we need your help to block it."

During the call, they will perform an action (like initiating a password reset or a transaction on your account) that triggers your wallet provider to send you a real OTP via SMS. The caller will then ask you to read that OTP back to them for "verification."

> Once you give them the OTP, they have full control. They can authorize payments, change your password, and empty your wallet balance within seconds. The OTP is the final key, and you just handed it to them.

### The Golden Rule of Security

**NEVER, EVER share your OTP with anyone.** No legitimate company employee, not from a bank, a digital wallet, or a government agency, will ever call you and ask for your OTP. It is meant for your eyes only, to be entered by you directly into the official app or website.

### What To Do If You Get a Scam Call

Hang up immediately. Do not engage in conversation. You can block the number. If you are worried, log into your wallet through the official app to check for any unusual activity. By staying vigilant and remembering the golden rule, you can easily defeat this common scam.
