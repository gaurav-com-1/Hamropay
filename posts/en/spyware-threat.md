Not all threats come from scam calls or messages. Some of the most dangerous threats are silent applications that you might have willingly installed on your own phone. This software is known as spyware or malware.

### What is a Malicious App?

A malicious app is one that pretends to be a useful tool—like a photo editor, a game, or a system cleaner—but its real purpose is to spy on you. It can run hidden in the background, performing harmful actions without your knowledge.

### How They Steal Your Information

Spyware uses several clever techniques to steal your credentials:

- **Keylogging:** The app records every key you press, including your usernames, passwords, and digital wallet PINs.
- **Screen Recording:** It can capture screenshots or record your screen when you open a financial app, revealing your balance and PIN.
- **Fake Login Overlays:** The app displays a fake login screen on top of your real wallet app. When you enter your details, it sends them directly to the scammer.

### How to Stay Safe from Spyware

> The single most important rule is to ONLY download apps from official sources like the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Never install an app (APK file) from a link sent to you in a message or from a random website.

Also, pay close attention to the permissions an app requests. A simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, camera, or messages. If an app asks for suspicious permissions, do not install it.
