A new wave of sophisticated phishing scams is targeting digital wallet users across Nepal. These are not the poorly-worded emails of the past; they are convincing messages and websites designed to steal your login credentials and hard-earned money.

### How the Scam Works

The scam typically begins with an SMS or a message on a social media app (like Viber or WhatsApp). The message creates a sense of urgency, claiming there's a problem with your account, a pending high-value transaction, or that you've won a lottery.

> The message will contain a link that looks like it leads to your wallet provider's official website (e.g., esewa.com.np, khalti.com). However, the link is fake and directs you to a clone website controlled by the scammer.

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Urgent or Threatening Language:** Phrases like "Your account will be suspended," or "Verify immediately to avoid fees."
- **Slightly Incorrect URLs:** Look closely at the website address. Scammers might use `esewa-login.info` or `khalti.payment-np.com` instead of the official domain.
- **Unsolicited Requests for Information:** A real company will never send you a link via SMS and ask you to log in to "verify" your account.
- **Poor Grammar or Design:** Even sophisticated scams can have small mistakes. Look for typos or logos that seem slightly off.

### What To Do

If you receive such a message, do not click the link. Delete the message immediately. If you are concerned about your account, manually type the official website address into your browser or use the official mobile app to check your account status. Report the scam number if possible.
