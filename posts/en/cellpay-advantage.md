CellPay operates on a different model compared to most digital wallets in Nepal. Instead of requiring users to load funds into a wallet, it facilitates direct payments from a user's bank account to the recipient's bank account. This "bank-linked" approach, powered by Nepal Clearing House's ConnectIPS system, has helped it attract over 1 million users.

### How is it Different?

The key difference is the absence of a stored value wallet. Your money always stays in your bank account until the moment of a transaction. For users, this has two primary perceived benefits:

1.  **Enhanced Security:** Many users feel more secure knowing their funds are not held by a third-party company but remain under the protection of their bank.
2.  **No Need to "Load" Funds:** This eliminates the hassle of constantly checking your wallet balance and topping it up from your bank account.

> With CellPay, your bank account _is_ your wallet. This simplifies the mental model of digital payments for many people.

### Core Services

CellPay offers all the standard services you'd expect, including:

- QR code payments
- Utility bill payments
- Mobile top-ups
- Fund transfers

The transactions are processed in real-time, just like with other wallets, but the funds are debited directly from the linked bank account.

### Is it for You?

CellPay is an excellent choice for users who prioritize security and prefer not to manage a separate wallet balance. It's particularly appealing to those who are more conservative with their finances and trust the traditional banking system more. While it may lack some of the loyalty programs or value-added services of wallet-based competitors, its straightforward and secure approach has earned it a loyal following.
