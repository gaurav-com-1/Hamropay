Scammers are getting more creative. Being aware of their common tactics is the best way to protect your money. Here are four scams that are frequently reported in Nepal.

### 1. The "You've Won a Lottery" Scam

You receive a call or message claiming you've won a large cash prize from a TV show or a lucky draw. To claim it, they say you must first send a smaller amount for "tax" or "processing fees" to a specific wallet. **Remember:** Legitimate lotteries never ask you to pay a fee to receive your prize.

### 2. The QR Code "Receive Money" Scam

A scammer, often posing as a buyer for an item you're selling online, will send you a QR code. They'll tell you to scan it to receive their payment. However, scanning a "Pay" QR code does the opposite: it sends money from your account to theirs.

> Always remember: You only scan a QR code to PAY someone. To RECEIVE money, you show YOUR QR code to them.

### 3. The "Fake Customer Support" Call

The caller pretends to be from your bank or digital wallet company. They'll create a sense of urgency, claiming your account has been blocked or has a security issue. They will then ask for your PIN or the OTP you just received on your phone to "verify" your identity and "fix" the problem. This is a direct attempt to gain access to your account.

### 4. The "Urgent Family Emergency" Plea

You get a frantic message from an unknown number or a hacked social media account of a friend or relative. They claim to be in an accident or emergency and urgently need you to send money. Always call the person directly using the number you have saved for them to verify the situation before sending any funds.
