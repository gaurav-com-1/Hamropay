Digital wallets have made our lives incredibly convenient, but with that convenience comes the responsibility of keeping our funds safe. Here are five essential, practical tips to secure your digital wallet, whether you use eSewa, Khalti, IME Pay, or any other service in Nepal.

### 1. Use a Strong, Unique PIN/Password

This is your first line of defense. Avoid using obvious combinations like your birth date, "1234," or "0000." Create a strong, random PIN and, most importantly, use a different one than your ATM or mobile banking PIN. Enable biometric authentication (fingerprint or face ID) if your phone and the app support it.

### 2. Beware of Phishing and Social Engineering

Scammers will try to trick you into revealing your details. They might call you pretending to be from the wallet's customer support, or send you a link to a fake website that looks real.

> Rule of thumb: A legitimate company will NEVER ask for your PIN, password, or OTP (One-Time Password) over the phone or email. Never.

### 3. Keep a Low Wallet Balance

Treat your wallet like a physical wallet, not a savings account. Only load the amount of money you expect to spend in the near future. Keep the bulk of your savings safely in your bank account. This minimizes your potential loss if your wallet is ever compromised.

### 4. Review Your Transaction History Regularly

Make it a habit to quickly scan your transaction history every few days. This helps you spot any unauthorized activity immediately. The sooner you detect a problem, the faster you can report it and get it resolved.

### 5. Secure Your Device

Your phone is the key to your digital wallet. Protect it with a strong screen lock (PIN, pattern, or biometric). Always keep your phone's operating system and your wallet app updated to the latest version, as updates often contain critical security patches.
