Phishing isn't just about emails anymore. Scammers now heavily rely on your phone to trick you. Understanding the difference between Vishing and Smishing can help you spot these threats instantly.

### Vishing: Voice Phishing

This is a scam conducted over a phone call. The scammer will impersonate someone from an organization you trust, like your digital wallet's support team, your bank, or even the tax office. They create a sense of urgency or fear.

**Common tactics include:**

- "Your KYC is expiring, we need to verify your details to keep your account active."
- "There has been a suspicious transaction on your account, please confirm your PIN to block it."
- "You have won a prize! We just need your details to transfer the money."

### Smishing: SMS Phishing

This is a scam conducted via text messages (SMS). The message will contain a link and will urge you to click it. These links lead to fake websites that look identical to the real ones.

> A classic example is a message saying: "Your eSewa account has been temporarily suspended. Please click here to reactivate," with a link to a fake login page.

The goal is to get you to enter your username and password on their fake site. They might also send messages with links to "claim a free data pack" or "get a special discount," all leading to malicious sites.

### The Unbreakable Rule

Whether it's a call (Vishing) or a text (Smishing), the defense is the same: **NEVER share your PIN, password, or OTP.** Legitimate companies will never ask for this information. If you're in doubt, hang up or delete the message, and contact the company yourself using their official phone number or app.
